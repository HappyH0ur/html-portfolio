<h2>The Best Movies According to Kristen</h2>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>
<p>This is my favourite film with Julia Roberts. I love the story and her character.</p>
<h3>My Cousin Vinny</h3>
<p>This movie is hilarity at its finest. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are a dynamo duo who make every bit of this film, serious or not, relatable and funny.</p>
<h3>Lake Placid</h3>
<p>What's funny about a giant crocodile trying to eat people in a lake? Witty repertoire from the entire cast, including Betty White!</p>
